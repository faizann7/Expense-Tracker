This is Daily Finance Tracking App.

For tables:
Use Datatables from shadcn just like the expensetable.
Use shadcn for all the components.
Use same hide for all table cells

Very Important: Try to use resuable components as much as possible, always first check if the component is already created or if we can resuse a previous component.

we dont have a backend , we're using lcoalstorage or this (i there is no localstorage we just show no data currently

use same cta everywhere , use expense table as a reference
